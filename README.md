# FreeMind is an addon that changes the way you use World of Warcraft
Still in alpha, opened beta soon...

FreeMind is a complete addon, made of several modules that do not use resources if they are not used.
  This does not drown the list of addons because the activation is done through the settings.

Instead of offering you no settings or too many,
  FreeMind will be like a house or a luxury car, a dream trip,
  which will adapt to your measurements, offering very personal options,
  in a coherent context between each module and wow.

It is programmed from scratch with particular attention to the code, its clarity, simplicity, optimization
  without the use of libraries except one to save variables.
You should know that the use of libraries was a good idea at the beginning to share common functions,
  but finally, encompassing them all, each loads them all,
  making a simple one-line instruction pass through two thousand lines of code,
  without helping to no longer run out of memory as at the beginning of wow.
So without lying, each module can consume or use up to a hundred times less resources than classic addons.

FreeMind relies on the FoxDB library which allows you to save variables according to the EditMode layout
  so you can make certain settings according to it, and for example dedicate it to the arena, pvp, farming etc
  in addition to keeping parameters according to the character (and independently) or for all

You will find in particular:

- ActionBar:
  - action bars, customizable under EditMode, and can adapt to different layouts.
  - they follow the display choice of wow settings, and add the minimum of resources.
  - the options are simple without being restrictive.
  - management of transparency and visibility, states, such as changing bars depending on which stance.
  - the bonus bar serves as a bar for professions, relax, or fishing and goes directly back to the first in combat.
  - self-adaptation of bars in case of vehicle, BattlePet etc. usable in gamepad mode.

- AssistMode:
  - which allows to establish priorities when it comes to targets, depending on the EditMode layout.

- GamePad:
  - there is a dedicated gamepad mode, non-intrusive, you switch from one to the other with a keyboard shortcut.
  - it is side by side, it does not replace your gaming experience, it completes it depending on the situation you choose
  - it is still efficient, very close to the console experience, associated with Buttons, Ring and CombatMode.
  - and has very simple solutions, like for healing targets, popups, quests etc.
  - when the gamepad is disconnected, you go directly back to standard mode.
  - the gamepad mode can change bars depending on the triggers and this independently on both sides.
  - while in mouse mode you choose whether you switch the entire bar with shift and control or not.

- CombatMode:
  - offers a great improvement of the cursor unlock for the gamepad.
  - but is also usable with the mouse, the buttons then allow you to target and interact.
  - a binding allows to interfere the current state, making you free when you want
  - or allowing to regain control of the direction by leaving a window open, returning to the normal state once released.

- Flyouts:
  - if you use ActionBar, Flyouts are displayed on bar 3 or on 1 if it is not available.
  - but you can also create custom ones using macros, starting with /flyout
  - there are a few commands to add to make it close when released, or on the first press, or not,
  - or that it simply moves bar 3 to another and then returns to 3.
  - we can make it not replace a button, letting you choose which ones.
  - we can add a few basic commands like closing the flyout,
  - we can drag more things than on a flyout than on classic bars, and Thumbnails.
  - and for example, we can see the number of quest objects, fish etc. that we have.
  - so don't hesitate to place some on bar 3 which will adapt to your needs.

- Buttons:
  - provide full gamepad support, with simplified solutions to do everything easily.
  - your gamepad bindings will be in the same place, and automated, even between multiple Xbox, Sony or Generic types,
  - unless you choose to do it manually.
  - some are usable with the keyboard, like for the ring, quests, or CombatMode inversion.

- Ring:
  - is precisely one of these buttons, revealing a simple circle with a flyout action bar.
  - so you can add a bunch of things that the classic bars don't support and have the count of the objects.
  - you can switch it to all bars 4 to 7.
  - in gamepad mode the character stops and you choose the action according to the direction of a cursor.
  - otherwise it's a classic action bar and you click it, and if used, the CombatMode will have been unlocked if necessary.

- Thumbmails:
  - set of script buttons, usable as is in a set that is displayed on the screen.
  - or draggable independently in custom flyouts.
  - about action bars, markers, targeting, object management, different states of module options etc.

- QuickMenu
  - You will find part of it in a QuickMenu, accessible by right-clicking on the location of the minimap.

- Nameplates:
  - with powerful but very simple options.
  - level, name, raid & elite icons, roles, text with guild or arena id.
  - scale, transparency, powerbar, castbar, absorb and predicted health.
  - auras, status, threat, combos, runes, quest icon & name.

- Quests:
  - which allows you to have a visual and/or vocal narrator, with male or female voices depending on the speaker.
  - to skip actual narrator, skip or abandon quest.
  - to auto-share, to automate the transition from one to the other during leveling sessions or quest sequences.
  - to be able to manage them very easily with a gamepad, to accept popup quests.

- TrackingBar:
  - offers visual fields directly on the reputation bar.
  - roll, specialisation, time, memory, bag, gamepad battery, latency, currencies, gold and durability.
  - some of which are customizable by right-clicking.

- Minimap:
  - which allows you to have a more pleasant one, with some settings accessible under EditMode.
  - circular, square, below, above, mouseover/out transparency, coordinates.
  - but also hide it, have it full screen with background or not, have the cardinal directions.
  - to be able to link directly with gathering addons when it is in full screen without background or with transparency.

- Distance:
  - which allows you to know the distance between you and the target outside of combat.
  - order of priority between the target, the focus and mouseover possible.

- Cursor:
  - a nice animation super well set, to never lose your cursor.
  - very useful with GamePad or CombatMode.

- Efficiency:
  - Addons Memory Usage.
  - Unregister error messages.
  - Auto-filled delete item.
  - Tooltips at cursor depending on the situation.
  - Sort groups.
  - Raid frames can be activated solo.

- MoveAnything:
  - which allows you to have free windows that do not close automatically.
  - but only what is needed.

- Faded screen:
  - which allows you to tire your eyes less.

- Faded away:
  - a standby when you are afk, clock, timer,
  - with darkened screen to let you sleep (if you are dozing off).
  - and possibility of your animated character.

- FoxDB icon manager:
  - to manage minimaps icons, of addons which use it, under EditMode.
  - not in conflict with addon compartment.
